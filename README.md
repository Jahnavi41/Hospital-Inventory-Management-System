Hospital Inventory Management System
Inventory management is a critical aspect of operations in any organization, particularly in the healthcare sector where the availability of essential supplies, medications, and equipment directly impacts patient care and safety. In this context, the development of an effective Inventory Management System (IMS) for hospitals is of paramount importance. This project aims to address the challenges associated with inventory management in a hospital setting by designing and implementing a comprehensive IMS tailored to the specific needs of the healthcare environment.

The main objectives of the project are:

Efficient Inventory Tracking: Develop a user-friendly system for tracking inventory transactions, including additions, deletions, and updates, to streamline inventory management processes and minimize manual effort.

Supplier Management: Implement a module to effectively manage supplier information, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration for procurement activities.

Item Catalog Management: Enable users to maintain and update a comprehensive catalog of inventory items, including details such as names, quantities, and categories, to ensure accurate inventory records.

Expiration Date Monitoring: Develop functionality to generate reports identifying medications nearing expiration, enabling timely action to prevent wastage and ensure patient safety.

Low Stock Alerts: Implement a feature to alert users or generate reports for items running low in stock, enabling proactive replenishment to avoid stockouts and disruptions in service.

Front End Tools 
For the front-end development of the IMS, HTML and CSS were primarily utilized. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format these web pages. These tools provide the foundation for creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the IMS. HTML enables the creation of structured content, such as forms for data entry and tables for displaying inventory information, while CSS allows for customization of the layout, typography, and color scheme to enhance usability and aesthetics. By leveraging HTML and CSS, the IMS ensures a seamless and intuitive user experience for hospital staff interacting with the system.

Back End Tools
The back-end infrastructure of the IMS is underpinned by PHP and MySQL, facilitated through the XAMPP control panel. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language adept at dynamic web development, facilitating data processing and logic implementation behind the scenes. MySQL, an open-source relational database management system, is enlisted for efficient storage and retrieval of data. XAMPP, a comprehensive web server solution bundle, encompasses Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, furnishing an integrated development environment for local web application construction and testing. By harnessing PHP and MySQL via the XAMPP control panel, the IMS adeptly manages inventory data, executes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and dynamically generates content in response to user interactions. This amalgamation of back-end tools ensures the reliability, scalability, and security of the IMS, fostering seamless integration with the front-end interface and furnishing a resilient solution for hospital inventory management.
