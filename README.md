Inventory management is a critical aspect of operations in any organization, particularly in the healthcare sector where the availability of essential supplies, medications, and equipment directly impacts patient care and safety. In this context, the development of an effective Inventory Management System (IMS) for hospitals is of paramount importance. This project aims to address the challenges associated with inventory management in a hospital setting by designing and implementing a comprehensive IMS tailored to the specific needs of the healthcare environment.
